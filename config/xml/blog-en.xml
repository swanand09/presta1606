			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding the right logo for your online store is one of the most important decisions you’ll make as an online merchant. As legendary Logo Designer <a href="http://www.lifeclever.com/paul-rand-thoughts-and-despair-on-logo-design/" target="_blank">Paul Rand</a> says, “A logo is a flag, a signature… a street sign.” Your logo should clearly define your business model for your target audience. With so many options and possibilities for logo designs, where should you start?</p>
<p>Today we’re sharing tips on how to find the right logo for your online store. We’ll start with 5 qualities to look for, then share examples of powerful logos from live PrestaShop Stores, and finish with valuable resources to help you find your perfect logo.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17241" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/EN_ECOMMERCE-DESIGN.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="250" /></p>
<p><span id="more-17240"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">5 Q</span><span style="color: #008080;">ualities You’ll Find in the Right Logo</span></h2>
<h4>1) Memorable and Unique</h4>
<p>our logo should visually convey features that set your company apart from the competition. It should also make a strong and lasting impression – something that customers can also easily recall. With that said, your logo should also be unique and not resemble another company’s logo too closely to avoid confusion.</p>
<h4>2) Appropriate</h4>
<p>Finding the appropriate logo is a 2 step process. First it should <strong>accurately describe your brand</strong>. Then ensure that message is conveyed to your <strong>target customer</strong>.</p>
<h4>3) Timeless</h4>
<p>Ensure your logo is timeless by not relying too heavily on trends. Not sure what design trends are? Think stylistic designs like gradients, transparent layers, and futuristic fonts that were popular a few years ago. See what they look with examples of 2008’s Design Trends from <a href="http://www.logoorange.com/logo-design-08.php" target="_blank">LogoOrange</a>.</p>
<h4>4) Properly Colored</h4>
<p>We naturally associate colors with ideas and feelings. Get the most out of your logo by using colors that represents your brand. According to <a href="https://99designs.com/launch/brand-identity-pack/7ac5d0fd8f00bb21/brief" target="_blank">99Designs</a>, some common association of color in Western Culture are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Red</strong></span>: Passion, Anger, Vigor, Love, Danger<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Orange:</strong></span> Creativity, Invigoration, Unique, Stimulation<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #e4c547;"><strong>Yellow:</strong></span> Knowledge, Energy, Joy, Intellect, Youth<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> Fertility, Wealth, Healing, Success, Growth<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> Knowledge, Trust, Tranquility, Calm, Peace, Cool<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #993399;"><strong>Purple:</strong></span> Royalty, Wisdom, Spirituality, Imagination<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;"><strong>White:</strong></span> Purity, Healing, Perfection, Clean, Virtue<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #999999;"><strong>Gray:</strong></span> Balance, Sophistication, Neutrality, Uncommitted<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Black:</strong></span>Fear, Secrecy, Formal, Luxury</p>
<p>Do not, however, rely solely on color for effect. Make sure your logo also works in black and white.</p>
<h4>5) Simple and Clear</h4>
<p>Logos are meant to be an easy way for customers to remember your company. Show your logo to a stranger for 10 seconds. Did they get a good idea of your brand and company from the logo? If not, simplify the design. Stick to no more than 2 types of unscripted fonts. Then, remove any unnecessary designs.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Let’s Get Technical</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          • <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Use vector images.</strong></span> These types of images are created with mathematical equations which allows them to be scaled small or large without pixelating. According to <a href="http://www.olypress.com/vector-vs-raster-graphics-in-printing/" target="_blank">Olympus Press</a>, “crisp edges” are the most important aspect of a logo. Vector images will ensure your logo keeps its crisp edges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          • <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Create logos in varying sizes.</strong></span> Your logo should be consistent across all areas of your online store. However, it may not always fit into the specified dimensions. Take for example the various default sizes for the different logos placements within PrestaShop. (Easily edit these from the Back Office &gt; Preferences &gt; Themes.)<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>           <span style="color: #ffffff;"> </span>         o Header Logo (350px X 99px)<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>       <span style="color: #ffffff;">    </span>          o Favicon (16px X 16px)<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>           <span style="color: #ffffff;"> </span>         o Store Icon (30px X 30X)<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>          • <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Create versions for different print mediums</strong></span>. Letter heads, business cards, envelopes, as well as advertising posters are just a few other places you might use your logo. Make sure you have a version that works with each medium you use.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Examples of Logos from PrestaShop Stores</span></h2>
<p>Check out these great logos! Can you guess what these PrestaShop merchants sell just from their logos?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.starcowparis.com/10-shop" target="_blank"><strong>Starcow Paris </strong></a><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17243" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/Starcow-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="90" /> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17244" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/StarcowImage2.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="151" /></h4>
<p><strong>Business Model:</strong> Premier Parisian retailer for streetwear with skate and hip-hop influence<br />
<strong>Why It Works:</strong> For starters, their logo is timeless. They steered clear of graffiti influence or highly styled fonts. Although the S in the logo has lots of character, it is still easy to understand. Furthermore, the scripted font reflects the prices and feel of their store; it’s refined with a little bit of edge and style.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.yumise.com/american-gourmandises" target="_blank"><strong>Yumise</strong></a><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17247" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/Yumise-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="168" /></h4>
<p><strong>Business Model:</strong> French retailer for edible American products<br />
<strong>Why It Works:</strong> This font is relevant for food lovers yet easy to understand. They clarify their unique brand name with a clear tagline below the store name to summarize the business model. It is simple but clearly shows the brand image.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://printthemall.com/" target="_blank">Print Them All</a></strong></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17242" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/printthemall-logo.png" alt="" width="152" height="176" /><br />
<strong>Business Model:</strong> Art dealer for prints from street artist.<br />
<strong>Why It Works:</strong>The use of gray, which projects neutrality, is perfect for an art dealer. The understated logo clearly communicates their role in the art process – feature the artist. The modern use of the fountain pens also shows the rebellious side of the company. This works well to showcase how they differentiate themselves in an established business market.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.todobonito.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Todo Bonito</strong><br />
</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17245" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/todobonito1.png" alt="" width="144" height="144" /><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17246" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/todobonito2.png" alt="" width="394" height="68" /></p>
<p><strong>Business Model:</strong> Downloadable cutout designs for children parties and celebrations.<br />
<strong>Why It Works:</strong> The doily pattern behind the text alludes to the products that company sells – paper with designs that can be cut out. They also have multiple logos for different size requirements. The square logo is perfect for social media profile images where the rectangular logo works well for ecommerce headers. Finally, the pink hues are perfect for their target audiences – moms planning kid parties.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are searching how to install PrestaShop, you came to the right place. With nearly 4 million downloads and over 185,000 active stores, installation tutorials are always a popular request. Thankfully, there are tons of resources online to help you install PrestaShop any way you like. You can install via a one-click installation script provided by your hosting provider. You can install it manually via MySQL and FTP. Lastly, you can install a localhost version of PrestaShop on your personal device for testing or development purposes. I’ll provide simple instructions for each of these scenarios. Enough with the introduction, let’s start installing!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/prestashop-1.6-604x272-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17286" title="prestashop-1.6-604x272-1" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/prestashop-1.6-604x272-1.png" alt="" width="604" height="272" /></a><span id="more-17189"></span></p>
<p>Before we get started you should get familiar with the <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Installing+PrestaShop">Official Installation Documentation</a>. This should serve as the point of reference for the various methods we will describe.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span><strong><span style="color: #552d36;">1. One Click Install:</span> </strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>If you guessed that this the easiest method to install PrestaShop, you would be right. The first step would be to have a web-hosting provider who has a one-click installation script for PrestaShop. Ask your hosting provider if they include a one-click install. There are three popular script libraries to install PrestaShop with one click.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.simplescripts.com/script_details/install:PrestaShop"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SimpleScripts</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://installatron.com/prestashop"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Installatron</span></a></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.softaculous.com/apps/ecommerce/PrestaShop">Softaculous</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p>All you need is the FTP information that your webhost provided you. Contact your host if you do not have your FTP credentials. Some hosts have their own installation scripts.</p>
<p>PrestaShop has teamed up with the best hosting companies that provide you with the easiest method to get your online store up and running. <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/ecommerce-hosting">Check out our Hosting page for more details.</a>  These are the hosts that know PrestaShop, with servers that are optimized for ecommerce performance.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #552d36;"><strong>2. Install PrestaShop Manually:</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>If you already have knowledge about MySQL databases and FTP, then this would be for you. We have provided an instructional video below.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/psz4aIPZZuk" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is a list of quick steps to install for the experienced users. For <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Installing+PrestaShop#InstallingPrestaShop-Detailedinstructions">more detailed instructions, see here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and unzip the PrestaShop package onto your computer.</li>
<li>Create a database for PrestaShop shop on your web server if it is possible. In case there is no MySQL user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying this database, create it as well.</li>
<li>Upload the PrestaShop files and folders to the chosen location on your web server. Do not upload the root /prestashop folder directly: only the files and folders that it contains.</li>
<li>Run the PrestaShop installation script by accessing the public URL for the chosen location in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the PrestaShop files.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on each screen of the installer.</li>
<li>Once the installation is done, delete the /install folder and write down the new of the /admin folder, which has been generated in order to be unique to you, for security reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #552d36;"><strong>3. Install PrestaShop Locally</strong>:</span></h3>
<p>A local installation means that PrestaShop is not live on the internet for the world to see, but it is live on your local computer or server. Only you can access to the local install. Having a local installation of PrestaShop is a great idea. You can test changes, upgrades and modules on a local installation on your computer without touching your live store.<br />
There are various tools you can use to install PrestaShop locally.  <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Installing+PrestaShop+on+your+computer">Refer to this page</a> in the documentation for Local installations.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> (Windows)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Solaris)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">MAMP</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably more useful are the are two local installation packages that include an out-of-the-box installation of PrestaShop. These make it easier for people who are less technical to have a local installation.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.easyphp.org/prestashop.php">EasyPHP</a> (Windows) -</li>
<li><a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/prestashop">BitNami</a> (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux) &#8211; <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/prestashop/README.txt">Installation Read Me</a></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #552d36;">Final Thoughts</span></h3>
<p>There you have it, a simple all-inclusive guide to installing PrestaShop virtually anywhere. If you have questions, the place to go would be our <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums/forum/7-installing-prestashop/">dedicated Forum for PrestaShop installation</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ecommerce in Peru is unlike anything we&#8217;ve seen so far. This ecommerce market is not only in its early stages of development but is also fighting to change consumer behavior. We’ve met with <a href="http://www.wataweb.com/" target="_blank">Wataweb</a>, a local web agency that builds online stores with PrestaShop, to learn more about ecommerce in Peru.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17185" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/PSWT-Lima-Main.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="375" /><span id="more-17183"></span></p>
<p>So what makes Peru so unique?</p>
<p>First,<strong> consumer behavior isn&#8217;t aligned with ecommerce practices</strong>. Shoppers regularly use cash and those who have credit cards are reluctant to enter their information online. Besides, Peruvian consumers also believe they should pay only upon receipt of goods.</p>
<p>Second,<strong> local banks are reluctant to open accounts for ecommerce merchants</strong>. This hurts the growth of ecommerce by limiting the number of online merchants. However there is good news! PayPal is changing the standard by partnering with leading local banks to help open accounts for online merchants.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17184" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/PSWT-Lima2.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="377" /></p>
<p>Peru is taking big steps to expand their ecommerce market and we sat down with Javier, Daniel and Dionisio from Wataweb to better understand their views and expectations for ecommerce in Peru.</p>
<p>Watch the video!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the most experienced of online shoppers still wants to have a sense of security when paying for goods online, especially if they are not yet familiar with your online store.</p>
<p>Building your visitors and potential buyers’ confidence is essential: your goal is to reduce your cart abandonment percentage and increase customer conversion, hence your sales. A survey carried out by eConsultancy shows that 58% of respondents abandoned their cart due to <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/11182-basket-abandonment-case-studies-and-tips-to-help-improve-your-conversion-rates#i.1yhza1nrqtd3qs" target="_blank">concerns about payment security</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17172" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/Image_Euros_UPC_Resizedaaaa.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="300" /></p>
<p><span id="more-17122"></span></p>
<h2>What are some simple ways to make buyers feel at ease shopping on your online store?</h2>
<p><strong>1</strong>. The most common security signs buyers will usually look for are a <strong>URL prefixed by ‘https’ and the little ‘padlock’ symbol</strong> next to it.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that even if your online store is secure, it’s important to show it! And visually implement all safety standards in order to make you customer feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. Making sure that your <strong>payment page is consistent with the overall look and feel of your store and brand identity</strong> is another way to reassure your customers that they are shopping on a safe site – on one and the same website.</p>
<p>More often than not, these pages are left unbranded, giving buyers the feeling that they are being redirected to another website.<br />
<strong>Applying some minimal branding</strong> to your payment page, e.g. your store logo or brand colours can help you convert more customers.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. However, shoppers will first check which payment methods are available on your online store and if they are trusted options, before proceeding with making a purchase.</p>
<h2>Secure payments through online bank transfers</h2>
<p>In Europe, online bank transfers are among the most popular online payment methods, for two main reasons:</p>
<p>- Most of the people have a bank account<br />
- Online bank transfers are usually offered by banks and government-approved companies</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of the advantages of online bank transfers and why this payment method ranks high among other payment options.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-17171 aligncenter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/Image5_EN.png" alt="" width="350" height="219" /></p>
<p><strong>Advantages for the customers:</strong><br />
First and foremost, customers are familiar with the internet banking environment. They simply have to enter their <strong>banking details and use their PIN</strong> to execute the payment. A familiar environment increases the feeling of security.</p>
<p>In addition, with online bank transfers <strong>customers can pay rapidly</strong> and expect their orders to be processed faster, which mean their goods will be dispatched sooner.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, that fact that online bank transfers are usually offered by banks and authorized companies, it means that customers trust the system and feel safe using it.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages for e-merchants:</strong><br />
For merchants, online bank transfers represent a <strong>fast and cost-effective way to receive payments</strong>. Thanks to the quick, real-time payment confirmation, they can ship the goods immediately, increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, online bank transfers offer <strong>protection against chargebacks</strong>, as payments cannot be so easily reversed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the overall <strong>handling costs tend to be lower</strong> than what the other payment methods offer.</p>
<h3>SOFORT – one of the leading direct payment providers in Europe.</h3>
<p>SOFORT Banking provides secure, online direct payments services to over 25,000 online stores in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>More than 12 million consumers</strong> have already made at least one payment with SOFORT Banking, benefiting primarily from:</p>
<p>- A convenient payment method, using familiar online banking details<br />
- High security thanks to a multi-level online banking authentication procedure and the use of unique confirmation codes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/LogoSOFORT_klarnagroupCompany_RGB°Resized.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17168 aligncenter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/05/LogoSOFORT_klarnagroupCompany_RGB°Resized.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="106" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SOFORT Banking</strong> is now available in eleven countries, including Germany. Online shoppers in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Italy, Spain, France and the UK can now use this payment method.</p>
<p><strong>PrestaShop e-merchants benefit from the following features:</strong></p>
<p>- Attractive conditions<br />
- Easy integration<br />
- No registration required for your customers<br />
- Real-time transaction confirmation</p>
<p>Take advantage of <a href="https://www.sofort.com/payment/users/register/prestashop_benefit" target="_blank">SOFORT’s exclusive special offer</a> for PrestaShop merchants: <strong>register until May 15th 2014</strong> to get one and half month for free &#8211; no monthly or transactions fees &#8211; and receive 50% off the installation fee, until June 30th 2014. <strong>The promotion is available to all new customers.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 25,000+ commits from 175+ contributors in only 18 months, PrestaShop’s GitHub branches are an enormous success. Use this Github Tutorial to join in on the action. Staying true to our commitment of being Open-Source, our GitHub Repositories are becoming increasingly active each day as more community developers collaborate together. We welcome and encourage everyone to contribute to our Ecommerce solution using GitHub. You want in? Great.  I’ll briefly describe what GitHub is and provide step by step instructions on how you can contribute to the PrestaShop software using GitHub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17072" title="Github Tutorial" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/THE-BEST-THINGAVAILABLE.png" alt="" width="580" height="250" /></p>
<h2><span id="more-17040"></span></h2>
<p>GitHub is fueled by the version control system Git, an Open-Source project built by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/an-interview-with-millenium-technology-prize-finalist-linus-torvalds/">Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux</a>. GitHub allows easy collaboration for developers to contribute by allowing them to “fork” (copy) project files, make changes and submit the changes to the owner of the project. The owner of the project can then easily review the changes and accept or decline the changes. All of this is done with a user-friendly navigation on a web-based interface.</p>
<p>It provides a central hub for anyone around the world to modify and submit code to a project, while still allowing the owner easy management collaboration with their respective contributors. GitHub, sums it up nicely, “Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other&#8217;s toes. It&#8217;s a distributed version control system.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>GitHub Tutorial: Contribute to PrestaShop in 10 Steps </strong></h2>
<p>PrestaShop 1.6 is written mostly in PHP. Other languages used throughout are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the Smarty templating language, SQL, and XML.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>5)        Next, click on “Fork” to copy the project to your personal Github account.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/4-Fork.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17046" title="4) Fork" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/4-Fork.png" alt="" width="558" height="134" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>6)      Create another Branch within your Fork for your changes. I named mine “My-Changes”</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/5-Create-branch.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17047" title="5) Create branch" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/5-Create-branch.png" alt="" width="580" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>7)       Once you are in your newly created branch, example “My-Changes”, navigate to the specific file you want to modify and click Edit. Make sure that <span style="font-size: 14px;">your code changes follow our </span><a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Coding+Standards">Coding Standards</a></h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>8)      Scroll to the bottom of the page and in Commit Summary, <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message">you <em>must </em>follow our notation rules</a> in order for your request to be committed.  Then click, “Commit Changes”</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>9)    <span style="color: #339966;">  <strong>[IMPORTANT] You must test your changes on your own local installation or test environment of PrestaShop to make sure the change is working as you expected.</strong> </span><br />
After you have tested and you are ready to move forward, you need to submit your Pull Request.  Navigate back to your Github branch, in my example it was named “My-Changes”,  and you will see a button to click that says “Compare &amp; pull request”</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/9-Compare-and-Pull.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17050" title="9) Compare and Pull" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/9-Compare-and-Pull.png" alt="" width="552" height="323" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, more than ever e-merchants must reassess and review their risk management and loss control procedures. With internet fraud on the rise again, according to Kroll’s Global Fraud Report – <a href="http://fraud.kroll.com/region-overview/canada/" target="_blank">‘69% of Canadian companies were affected at least by one fraud in 2012 / 2013&#8242;</a> &#8211; ecommerce businesses are particularly at risk.</p>
<p>Typically, credit card fraud can result in thousands of dollars in losses but, that’s not all. Fraud also puts your merchant account contract at risk and can damage your business’ reputation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17036" title="Desjardin Image" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Desjardin-Image.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="260" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-16979"></span>As fraud attacks are rampant and causing huge losses to merchants, let’s review together how to spot potential fraud and what you can do to safeguard your business.</p>
<h2>Identifying fraudulent activities</h2>
<p>Most of the online sales are ‘Card Not Present’ transactions; this means that the e-merchant is confronted with a particularly difficult challenge when it comes to verifying and validating credit cards, as the card is not physically presented to the e-merchant for inspection.</p>
<p><strong>So, how can you spot ‘Card Not Present Fraud’?</strong><br />
Here are some of the characteristics or unusual purchasing patterns that you should be on the lookout for:</p>
<p><strong>1.Larger than usual purchases</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.Multiple purchases of the same expensive item</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.Buying the most expensive model</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.Many large purchases in rapid succession</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.Multiple cards used from a single IP address</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.Placing an order using a free email service</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.In addition, pay attention to special shipping requests:</strong></p>
<p>- ‘Express’ or ‘overnight’ delivery<br />
- Shipping to a single address but using multiple credit cards<br />
- Many purchases, using one card, and shipping to multiple addresses</p>
<h2>What measures can you take to prevent fraud?</h2>
<p>1. First and foremost, make sure that your <strong>online store is protected, to prevent potential attacks;</strong> that all account information is securely stored and that you work with PCI-compliant processors. Attacking computer systems and databases is the most common method for<strong> information theft.</strong></p>
<p>2. As a minimum requirement, online stores accepting credit cards should request customers to enter <strong>the security code, called the CVC or CSC or CVV2</strong> usually found at the back of the card. As this type of information is more difficult for cybercriminals to obtain.</p>
<p>3. Ask your Bank/Payment Processor to provide <strong>address verification services;</strong> checking whether the billing address and the delivery address match. Although, this is not always a sign of fraud, be wary if the addresses don’t match and the card holder requires express delivery.</p>
<p>4. Implement a <strong>3D secure protocol,</strong> which requires the customer to create a private code, when paying online. Again, this is something your Credit Card Processor can advise you on.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Compare the IP location with the billing address</strong> to make sure they’re in the same country.</p>
<p>6. For international customers, obtain an updated list of high-risk fraud countries; you can <strong>block the country IP or use geo-location technologies that can help you evaluate which transactions are valid and which are potentially fraudulent.</strong></p>
<p>7. Especially, for expensive items, use a carrier that requires <strong>ID and a POD</strong> (proof of delivery).</p>
<p>The above list is by no means exhaustive!</p>
<p>If you suspect that a transaction might be fraudulent, it seems obvious but, refrain from shipping your goods without further verification. Check that the billing and the ship-to address match and contact the card holder, if possible.</p>
<p>If necessary, escalate accordingly by following your Processor’ loss control procedure.</p>
<h3>Advanced fraud screening with Desjardins’ fraud prevention tools</h3>
<p>Desjardins is the largest financial cooperative in Canada. Desjardins and PrestaShop have teamed up and developed a module that comprises a full range of transactions: credit card payments, refund and cancellation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The module includes advanced fraud protection tools, such as:</strong></p>
<p>- Security code / CVV2<br />
- 3D Secure: Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code (optional)<br />
- Fraud prevention module.</p>
<p>The fraud prevention module helps you <strong>limit and block risky payments</strong> by applying specific filters that can be configured, according to business’ needs.</p>
<p>With Desjardins, you can benefit from highly competitive rates &#8211; exclusively for PrestaShop users:</p>
<p>- Monthly fee: $0<br />
